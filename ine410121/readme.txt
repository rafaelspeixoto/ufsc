This repository corresponds to the work developed for the Computer Vision class (INE410121). 

The objective of the work is to classify failures in nonwoven fabrics. The project tested two approaches: deep learning and classical computer vision. The deep learning model used convolutional neural networks (ResNet34). The classical method used wavelet decomposition in five levels, together with the energy of each one, to extract texture information and feed a random forest classifier. Both algorithms obtained 100% accuracy.
